## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Password visibility toggle not working**
   - Ensure you're clicking the eye icon on the right side of the password field
   - Clear browser cache and refresh the page
   - Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser

2. **Duplicate meals still showing in Discover**
   - The filtering happens automatically after copying a meal
   - Try refreshing the page or switching between tabs
   - Ensure you're logged in with the correct account

3. **Placeholder images not displaying**
   - Verify that the ChefHat icon library is loaded (Lucide React)
   - Check browser console for any CSS or JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

4. **Drag and drop not working**
   - Ensure @dnd-kit libraries are installed (`yarn install`)
   - Check that draggable elements have proper drag attributes
   - Verify browser supports HTML5 drag and drop API

5. **"JSON parsing error" when creating meals**
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Check network connectivity and API accessibility
   - Verify Supabase connection is working

6. **Image upload fails**
   - Check Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
   - Ensure image is under 10MB and in supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
   - Verify internet connectivity

7. **AI suggestions not working**
   - Verify `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables
   - Check internet connectivity and API availability
   - Ensure prompt is descriptive enough (required field)

8. **Calendar meal plans not persisting**
   - Check Supabase connection and meal_plans table exists
   - Verify user authentication is working properly
   - Check browser network tab for API errors

### Development Tips

1. **Supabase Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables
   echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   
   # Check Supabase project status in dashboard
   # Ensure all tables are created with proper schema
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```bash
   # Clear localStorage if experiencing auth issues
   localStorage.clear()
   
   # Hard refresh the page
   Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

3. **Check Application Logs**
   ```bash
   # View Next.js development logs
   yarn dev
   
   # Check supervisor logs (production)
   sudo supervisorctl status
   tail -f /var/log/supervisor/nextjs.out.log
   ```

4. **Database Debugging**
   ```sql
   -- Check table existence in Supabase
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   
   -- Verify data integrity
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meals;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meal_plans;
   ```

5. **Component Debugging**
   ```javascript
   // Check drag and drop state
   console.log('Draggable meal:', draggedMeal);
   
   // Verify meal data structure
   console.log('Meal data:', meal);
   
   // Check authentication
   console.log('User token:', localStorage.getItem('forkcast_token'));
   ```
